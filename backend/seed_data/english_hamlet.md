# Hamlet: Themes and Analysis

## Key Themes

### 1. Action vs. Inaction
Hamlet’s famous "To be or not to be" soliloquy encapsulates his paralysis. He constantly debates whether to act (avenge his father) or suffer in silence. This hesitation leads to the tragic downfall of almost everyone in the play.

### 2. Appearance vs. Reality
- **Claudius**: Appears as a benevolent king but is a murderer.
- **Polonius**: Acts as a loyal advisor but spies deceitfully.
- **Hamlet**: Feigns madness to mask his true investigation.

### 3. Madness
Is Hamlet truly mad, or just pretending? Ophelia's madness, however, is genuine, driven by her father's death and Hamlet's rejection.

## Character Analysis
- **Hamlet**: Intellectual, melancholy, indecisive.
- **Claudius**: Manipulative, power-hungry, guilty.
- **Ophelia**: Obedient, fragile, victim of circumstances.
- **Polonius**: Pompous, meddling.
