# Calculus: The Study of Change

## Core Concept: Derivative
The derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function. It represents the slope of the tangent line to the curve at a point.

## Rules of Differentiation

### Power Rule
$$ \frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = nx^{n-1} $$
*Example*: $\frac{d}{dx}(x^3) = 3x^2$

### Product Rule
$$ (uv)' = u'v + uv' $$

### Quotient Rule
$$ (\frac{u}{v})' = \frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2} $$

### Chain Rule
Used for composite functions:
$$ \frac{d}{dx}f(g(x)) = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x) $$

## Common Derivatives
- $\sin(x) \rightarrow \cos(x)$
- $\cos(x) \rightarrow -\sin(x)$
- $e^x \rightarrow e^x$
- $\ln(x) \rightarrow \frac{1}{x}$
